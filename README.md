# JavaScript BPMN (Prototype)

Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) is a standard for business process modelling that provides a graphical notation for specifying business processes in a Business Process Diagram (BPD), based on a flowcharting technique very similar to activity diagrams from Unified Modelling Language (UML).

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to develop a BPMN Viewer and Modeller.
At the moment, its just a really rough idea and the code is pre-beta.

Initially support will be for Internet Explorer, Google Chrome and Firefox.

## Goals

Short term:
* Graphically view BPMN in the Web Browser.
* Load and Save BPMN XML.
* Save as an SVG file.

Long term:
* Graphically model BPMN in the Web Browser.
* Allow for different Graphics Rendering (i.e. SVG vs. HTML5 Canvas).
* Allow for different Models such as XPDL or BPEL or even XAML.
